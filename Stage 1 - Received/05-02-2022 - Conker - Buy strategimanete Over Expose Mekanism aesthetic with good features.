## Proposal Summary
Buy strategic Over Expose Mekanism cnft (with good features and good prices). 


## Proposal Details
We propose that the Chief DAO use between 4043 ADA (if all three recommended items are purchased) or 2143 ada (if only two items are purchased) from the treasury funds to resell at an appropriate price throughout this year.

(Over Expose) is this year's most anticipated project which has traded for over 1.39 million ADA on jpeg.store and which this year is expected to announce exclusive benefits for members, the price has pretty well tanked the market situation and in the long term I would not be surprised to see it grow by 100% (under the right conditions).


Up to 4043 ADA will be used to buy some of your NTS with better aesthetics and features which is the major focus of the collection. The NFTs purchased have been selected after a long research of their features aided by a fine art student's knowledge of aesthetics, the collection will be kept until the black paper comes out and the hype is sky high (no exact date but this year). At that time, the DAO will vote on whether to sell them for the appropriate price of 5000 ada or continue to hold the assets and receive whatever profits the development team may be planning.
    
Ideally, the vote should be held the week of the collection's black paper release or after a hype news.
